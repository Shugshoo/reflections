Udacity GitHub Reflections for Lesson 3 "Using GitHub to collaborate"
Well, the first thing to note in this lesson is that they want me to push my reflections notes
from these lessons up to a public GitHub repository. So, joke's on me for A) my pretty informal
note taking style here; and B) the fact that I've been keeping most of my useful notes (like 
commands learned, and the personal notes on what to remember when setting up my own repo) are 
all kept in Evernote, since that's where I keep most of my useful life-organizing material.

For the remainder of this note I will follow the actual Udacity provided prompts:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working on a large project with multiple other contributers who need to push to a single, unified branch. Or, when
you are working on a branch from many different machines and locations and you want a non-local repository to act as your single
source of truth for what constitutes a current, working program. Or, when you've reached a releasable milestone and want to make
the code available to a wide audience for consumption, forking, etc.
