I am supposed to create a new file to track my lessons for Udacity's second GitHub lesson,
which is walking me through initializing a new GitHub repository (git init), checking the status
of the github repository I'm currently working in (git status) and adding a file to the "staging
area" (through git add <filename>) which is where all the files being tracked for the upcoming
commit are supposed to be logged prior to actually making a commit.
