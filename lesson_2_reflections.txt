I am supposed to create a new file to track my lessons for Udacity's second GitHub lesson,
which is walking me through initializing a new GitHub repository (git init), checking the status
of the github repository I'm currently working in (git status) and adding a file to the "staging
area" (through git add <filename>) which is where all the files being tracked for the upcoming
commit are supposed to be logged prior to actually making a commit.


A little over a quarter way through the lesson I'm given the following prompts for reflection:
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By using "git diff --staged" to show all the differences between the staging area and the most
recent commit. If there are more changes than I mean to make in the particular bug / feature / 
other change I want to make, then I can edit the files or remove a file from the staging area 
before proceeding with the commit.
